# Pacman-tree-search

This project is the course project of UC Berkeley, Compsci 188.
---------------------------------------------------------------

In this project, we are required to implement algorithms like breath first search, depth first search, uniform cost search and A star search

Moreover, we have to define state and their representations in different situation and problems.
